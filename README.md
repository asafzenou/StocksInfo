This is a stock project that utilizes several methods to calculate the current stock price. Inspired by Rule Number 1 Workshop, the formulas for calculating stock value were derived from YouTube videos. It's important to note that this is not a recommendation to buy or sell stocks.

In this software, there are two options: 'Compute Company Info' and 'Compute Stock Analysis.'

Under 'Compute Company Info,' input the stock ticker symbol to receive all the technical data needed for calculating the purchase price (designed for manual verification). This section provides comprehensive technical information about the chosen company for assessing its buy price.

Under 'Compute Stock Analysis,' input the company's future growth rate (which must be above 15%). The software operates on a text file containing a substantial list of stocks. It filters out the stocks recommended for immediate purchase and those that aren't advisable for purchase at present.

It's essential to emphasize that all the basic checks are conducted on each stock to ensure its stability and suitability, following the principles taught in the Rule Number 1 Workshop. This section aims to compile a list of companies that one might want to keep aside and await the opportune moment for purchase.

Again, it's crucial to reiterate that this isn't a recommendation for buying or selling stocks. The purpose of this project is for my personal self-learning.

As noted in the software: 'Created by Asaf Zenou, inspired by Rule Number 1 Workshop. It's important to note that the formulas themselves for the calculation were taken from YouTube, and this is not advice for buying or selling stocks.
